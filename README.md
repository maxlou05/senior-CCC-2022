# senior-CCC-2022

This is my first time participating in the CCC, obtaining a score of 26/75.
The questions were quite challenging for me, so I only answered questions 1, 2, and 4.
Over the course of this competition, I realized that I have much to learn about efficient algorithms, as many of my algorithms exceeded the time limit.

The questions can be found here: https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html
